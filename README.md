# Personal Movie Quote API

A simple RESTful API built in Kotlin with Spring Boot for managing and exploring famous movie quotes. This backend application allows users to add, list, retrieve, delete, and search quotes, as well as view a "quote of the day" that changes based on the current date. Data is stored in-memory (no database required).

## Features

- Add new quotes with text, character, movie, and release year.
- List all quotes.
- Retrieve a specific quote by ID.
- Delete a quote by ID.
- Search quotes by character name or movie title (case-insensitive substring match; optional parameters).
- Get the quote of the day (deterministic selection based on date; consistent throughout the day, changes daily).

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher.
- Gradle (included in the project via wrapper).

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aaayushm23/Moviequotes.git
   cd Moviequotes
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```
   ./gradlew build  # On Unix-like systems
   .\gradlew.bat build  # On Windows
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun  # On Unix-like systems
   .\gradlew.bat bootRun  # On Windows
   ```
   - The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.
   - Data resets on restart (in-memory storage).

## Running Tests

The project includes automated tests covering key logic:

- Unit tests for service methods (e.g., add, delete, search, quote of the day).
- Integration tests for API endpoints (e.g., valid/invalid inputs, HTTP status codes).

To run tests:

```
./gradlew test  # On Unix-like systems
.\gradlew.bat test  # On Windows
```

- Tests use JUnit and Spring Boot Test framework.
- View results in `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

## Endpoints

All endpoints are under `/api/quotes`. Use tools like Postman or curl for testing.

## Notes

- **In-Memory Storage**: Quotes are stored in a list; data is lost on app restart.
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP codes (e.g., 400 for validation errors, 404 for not found).
- **Quote of the Day Logic**: Uses date-seeded random index for daily consistency (changes tomorrow if quotes exist).
- **Dependencies**: Spring Boot Starter Web, Validation; Kotlin reflect.
- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/aaayushm23/Moviequotes (includes all code and this README).
